# CUNY-SPS-Data607-Assignment-2

Assignment – SQL and R 
 
⌂ Choose six recent popular movies.  Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) to rate each of these movie that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5.  Take the results (observations) and store them in a SQL database.  Load the information into an R dataframe. Your deliverables should include your SQL scripts and your R Markdown code, posted to GitHub. 
 
This is by design a very open ended assignment.  A variety of reasonable approaches are acceptable.  You can (and should) blank out your SQL password if your solution requires it; otherwise, full credit requires that your code is “reproducible,” with the assumption that I have the same database server and R software. You may work in a small group.
